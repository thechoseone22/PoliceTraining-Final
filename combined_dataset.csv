**(00:00:55)  [Subject slowly turns around, hands up slightly]**

**Officer Miller:**  Okay, that's good.  Easy now.  Let's just take a deep breath.  Why were you running?

**Subject (Mark Johnson):** (Shaking slightly) I...I panicked.  I'm sorry.

**(00:01:05)  [SOUND of Officer Miller patting Mark down, finding no weapons]**

**22:45:17 Male Subject (Mark Johnson):**  (Voice slightly raised, but controlled) ""She... she just won't listen! I’m just trying to talk to her...""

**22:45:21 Officer Miller:**  ""Sir, I understand you're upset.  It looks like there's been a misunderstanding.  Can you take a few deep breaths for me?"" (Pause) ""Let's try to calm things down before things escalate further.""

**22:45:42 Mark Johnson:** ""She left her phone in my car.  I was just trying to give it back. She accused me of stealing it, and started screaming.""

**22:45:50 Officer Miller:** ""Okay, I understand.  It sounds like a simple misunderstanding that escalated quickly.  Sometimes the stress of the day can lead to things getting out of hand.""  (Officer Miller gestures toward the phone, retrieved from the ground.) ""I think we have the phone here. This will help resolve things, hopefully.”

**(Audio: Sounds of handcuffs being applied, quiet sounds of struggle, then compliance)**

**22:46:35 Officer Miller:** ""Alright, sir, you’re under arrest.  You have the right to remain silent..."" (Continues reading Miranda rights)

**22:47:02 Officer Miller:** (To Sarah Lee) ""Ma'am, are you alright? Do you need any further assistance?""

**22:47:07 Sarah Lee:**  ""Yes officer. Thank you for your help.""

**Subject (John Doe):** (Voice shaky) Uh, yeah, everything's fine, officer.  Just... a little stressed, I guess.

**(00:00:40)**

**Officer Miller:** I understand, sir.  Stress can really get to a person.  It's late, and I can see you're looking a little overwhelmed. Can you tell me what's going on?

**Officer Miller:**  (Draws taser, keeping it pointed down, maintaining distance) Mr. Doe, I need you to slowly raise your hands above your head and turn around.  Do you understand?

**Officer Miller:** Okay, good. Now, I’m going to need you to come with me quietly.  We're going to get you some help.  We can arrange for someone to talk to you, get you some resources.

**Officer Miller:**  (To himself, muttering) Okay, stay alert.  Keep hands visible.

**(00:00:30) Officer Miller approaches a man, approximately 6 feet tall, wearing a dark jacket, holding a baseball bat. The man is visibly agitated.**

**Officer Miller:** Sir, police!  Can you please drop the bat and step away from it?

**(00:00:40) Subject doesn’t respond. He swings the bat slightly, his eyes darting around nervously.**

**Officer Miller:** Sir, I need you to put the bat down.  I'm not here to hurt you, but I need you to cooperate.  This is for your safety and everyone else’s.  Take a deep breath.

**(00:00:55) Subject mumbles something unintelligible.  He takes a step closer to the officer, still holding the bat.**

**Officer Miller:** (Slightly raising his voice) Sir, slow down.  Let's just talk this through.  Put the bat down.  There’s no need for this.

**(00:01:10) *Officer Miller adopts a defensive stance, hands visible but slightly raised*  **

**Officer Miller:**  Sir, I'm going to ask you one more time. Put the bat down.

**(00:02:10) (Subject continues to grumble, but remains relatively still.  He doesn't make any sudden movements.)**

**Officer's Notes (added after incident):**  Subject, Mr. Henderson, appeared to be experiencing a significant mental health episode.  While the initial welfare check was intended to be non-confrontational, his aggressive behavior left me with no choice but to deploy my taser in order to secure his safety and that of myself and responding officers.  He sustained a fractured arm and a minor concussion during the incident, per paramedics’ report.  A statement from the concerned party who initially called has been secured.  A formal review of the event will be conducted per departmental policy.

**(00:01:00) Subject takes a step back, knife still in hand.**

**Subject:**  You don't understand!  Nobody understands!

**Officer Miller:**  Sir, I may not understand everything you’re going through, but I can understand feeling overwhelmed and alone.  Sometimes, just talking to someone can make a difference.

**(00:01:15) Audio:  Slight tremor in Officer Miller's voice, but maintains a calm demeanor.**

**Officer Miller:**  Can we put the knife down, sir?  It's making me feel uneasy, and I'm sure it's making you feel uneasy too.  Let's just talk.

**Subject:**  (Voice lower) I... I just... need to be left alone.

**Officer Miller:**  I hear you, sir.  I really do.  But we're concerned. We just want to make sure you're safe.  Perhaps we can sit down and talk about what's troubling you?  Then, if you'd like, we can get you some help.

**Subject:** (Whispering) Okay...

**(00:00:15) Subject (slurred speech): I...I ain't got none of that.  Just leave me alone.**

**Officer Miller:** Sir, I need to see your license and registration.  I stopped you for running a red light.  This is for your safety and mine.

**(00:00:20) Subject: I told you, leave me alone! (Subject reaches towards the center console.  A glint of metal is visible.)**

**Officer Miller:**  Sir, keep your hands where I can see them!  Do not reach for anything!

**(00:00:23)  [Sound of Officer Miller drawing his taser]**

**Officer Miller:**  Sir, I’m going to ask you again, slowly and calmly. Show me your hands.  Just put your hands on the steering wheel. There's no need for this.

**Officer:** Officer Miller, Badge #472

**Date:** October 27, 2023

**Time:** 22:45:00

**(00:00:00) Beginning of Recording.  Ambient sounds of city traffic and distant sirens.**

**(00:00:15) Officer Miller approaches a residence.  A man, later identified as Mr. David Jones, is standing on the porch, visibly agitated, holding a large kitchen knife.**

**Officer Miller:** (Calm, clear voice)  Sir, I'm Officer Miller.  Can you please put the knife down?

**(00:00:22) Mr. Jones shouts, waving the knife erratically.**

**Mr. Jones:** Get away from me!  Stay back!  I'll kill you!

**(00:00:28) Officer Miller slowly raises his hands, palms outward, maintaining a non-threatening posture.  Ambient sounds increase slightly as more sirens approach in the distance.**

**Officer Miller:** Sir, I understand you're upset.  But please put the knife down.  We can talk about this.  There's no need for anyone to get hurt.

**(00:00:40) Mr. Jones continues to shout incoherently, occasionally lunging slightly, but not advancing directly towards Officer Miller. The sound of a woman's voice crying can be heard from inside the house.**

**Mr. Jones:** (Shouting)  They're all against me!  They're going to... they're going to...

**(00:00:55) Officer Miller takes a slow step back, maintaining eye contact but keeping his hands visible and relaxed.**

**Officer Miller:** Sir, let's take a deep breath.  Just put the knife down. Let's talk.  I’m here to help.

**(00:01:10) Officer Miller continues to use slow, deliberate movements and calm, reassuring language.  He maintains open, non-threatening body language, avoiding any sudden or aggressive movements.  The woman's crying inside the house becomes louder.**

**(00:01:35) Mr. Jones pauses, his breathing becoming slightly more controlled.  He seems to be wavering.**

**(00:01:48) Mr. Jones slowly lowers the knife.  He hesitates, then drops it to the ground.**

**Officer Miller:** Thank you, sir.  Good. Now, can you tell me what's going on?

**(00:02:00) Mr. Jones begins to speak, his voice still shaky, but no longer aggressive. The narrative of his distress is incomprehensible at first, suggesting a mental health crisis.**

**(00:03:15) Backup arrives.  Officer Miller communicates briefly with the other officers, ensuring they maintain a calm and non-confrontational approach.  Mr. Jones is subsequently taken into custody by two other officers without further incident under the Mental Health Act.**

**Officer Miller:** (Maintains calm, professional tone)  Sir, I’m just checking in.  It’s late, and this area’s a little quiet.  I understand things may be difficult sometimes, but I'd like to understand what’s going on if you’re comfortable sharing.

**(00:00:12) [Subject suddenly starts to run.  Sound of rapid footsteps on pavement. Officer Miller draws his firearm.]**

**Officer Miller:**  Police! Stop!  Don't run!

**Officer Miller:** (Slightly raised voice, but still controlled) Sir, I’m not going to hurt you! Just stop running, please!  I want to understand what’s going on.  I’m here to help.

**(00:00:20) [Subject trips and falls.  A small metallic object – seemingly a wrench – falls from under his jacket.]**

**Officer Miller:** (Approaches cautiously, firearm still drawn, but pointed down) Sir, stay on the ground. Hands where I can see them.

**(00:00:25) [Subject is lying on the ground, hands visibly empty.]**

**Officer Miller:** (Lowering his weapon slightly)  It’s okay, sir.  You’re safe.  I saw you drop that. It seemed you were concerned, and I understand that.  Sometimes, people need a little help.  Are you alright? Do you need medical attention?  Is there anything I can do to help?


**(00:00:35) [Subject is visibly shaking and starts to cry softly.]**

**Subject:** (Whispering) I...I just... I didn’t know what to do.

**Officer Miller:**  I understand.  Take a deep breath.  Tell me what’s going on. We can figure this out together.  Are you lost?  Do you need a ride somewhere?  We have resources that can help.

**(00:00:45) [Sounds of approaching backup officers.]**

**Officer Miller:** (To backup officers) Unit 3, we have the subject secured.  No injuries.  Seems like he just needed some assistance.

**22:47:30 Sarah Jenkins:** ""Officer, please help me. He’s...he’s scaring me.""

**22:47:33 Officer Miller:** (Maintaining a calm, non-threatening posture, hands visible) ""Ma'am, it’s alright. Can you tell me what’s happening?  Take a deep breath.""  **(Officer Miller subtly places her hand on her taser, concealed but readily accessible.)**

**(A man, MARK JENKINS, appears behind Sarah. He looks agitated, hands clenched.)**

**22:47:42 Mark Jenkins:**  ""She's lying! I didn't do anything!""

**22:47:45 Officer Miller:** (Slow, deliberate speech) ""Sir, I need you to step back and let me talk to your wife. I'm here to make sure everyone's safe.""  **(Officer Miller makes slow, deliberate hand gestures indicating she wants him to step back, keeping her distance but maintaining a visible, non-aggressive stance.)**

**22:47:50 Mark Jenkins:**  (Takes a step back, but remains close) ""I just... we were arguing, that's all.""

**22:47:55 Officer Miller:**  ""I understand arguments happen. But your wife called 911, and she seems distressed.  Can you please step away from her, give her some space?""  **(Officer Miller subtly adjusts her stance, putting more distance between herself and Mark, while still remaining near Sarah for protection.)**

**(Mark Jenkins hesitates, then takes several more steps back.)**

**22:48:05 Sarah Jenkins:** (Wipes her eyes) ""He... he grabbed my arm.  He threatened to..."" (She trails off, visibly shaken)

**22:48:10 Officer Miller:** (To Mark Jenkins) ""Sir, I'm going to need you to step outside. I need to speak to your wife privately.  Is that okay?""

**22:48:15 Mark Jenkins:** (Sighs heavily) ""Fine.""

**(Sarah Jenkins shakes her head, but continues to appear distressed.)**

**22:48:23 Officer Miller:** (To Mark Jenkins, who is now outside) ""Sir, please keep your hands where I can see them.""

**(Backup arrives at 22:48:30. Officer Davies joins Officer Miller.)**

**22:48:35 Officer Miller:** (To Officer Davies) ""He's being cooperative for now, but I'm going to cuff him.  Domestic disturbance, possible assault.""

**(Mark Jenkins is handcuffed without incident. He does not resist.)**

**22:49:00 Officer Miller:** (To Mark Jenkins) ""You're under arrest for domestic assault. You have the right to remain silent..."" (Miranda rights are read)

**(Mark Jenkins remains silent, but nods his head.)**

**22:49:35 Officer Miller:** (To Sarah Jenkins) ""Ma'am, we're going to take him to the station.  We'll have someone stay with you to ensure your safety. Do you need medical attention?""

**(Sarah Jenkins shakes her head.)**

**(Mark Jenkins is taken into custody. The scene ends with Officer Miller reassuring Sarah.)**

**Mark Jenkins:** (Shouting) What do you want?!  Get off my property!

**Officer Miller:** (Calmly) Sir, we received a call about a domestic disturbance at this address.  Can you please step outside so we can talk?

**Officer Miller:** Sir, I need you to step outside peacefully. We need to ensure everyone is safe.

**Mark Jenkins:** (Leaning closer, voice rising)  You're gonna make me come out there, huh?  I'll show you what I can do. I'll...I'll hurt you. You hear me?

**(00:00:45) Officer Miller subtly adjusts his stance, hand resting on his taser but not drawing it.**

**Officer Miller:** Sir, I understand you're upset, but threatening an officer is a serious crime.  Step outside now, or I will be forced to take further action.

**(00:00:55) Mark Jenkins pauses, breathing heavily. He looks at Sarah, then back at the officer.**

**Mark Jenkins:** (Muttering) Fine.  Fine. Don't think I like this.

**(00:01:05) Mark Jenkins steps out of the house. Officer Miller maintains a safe distance, keeping his eyes on Mark.**

**Officer Miller:** Sir, please place your hands where I can see them.  And keep your hands where I can see them.

**Officer Miller:** Okay, sir.  You're under arrest for threatening a police officer and disturbing the peace.  You have the right to remain silent... (continues with Miranda Rights).

**(00:02:30)  Sarah Jenkins walks outside and speaks to the other officer who's arrived.**

**Officer Miller:** (To Sarah Jenkins)  Ma'am, are you alright?  Do you need medical attention or somewhere to go tonight?

**(00:03:00) Sarah Jenkins nods, visibly shaken, but declines further assistance at the moment.**

**(00:03:15) Mark Jenkins is escorted to the police car.  The barking dog can still be heard faintly in the background.**

**Officer Miller:** (00:01:22) ""Thank you for your cooperation.  Just so we are clear, can you explain what caused the initial disturbance?""

**Officer Miller:** (00:01:33) ""Okay.  Well, I appreciate you turning down the music. However, we've had previous complaints about noise from this address, and there's an outstanding warrant for your arrest for unpaid traffic fines.""

**John Doe:** (00:01:45)  ""Oh, man.  I... I totally forgot about those.  Yeah, I'll take responsibility for that.""

**(00:01:50) Officer Miller explains the arrest procedure calmly. John Doe remains cooperative, offers no resistance.**

**Officer Miller:** (00:02:00) ""Okay John, please put your hands behind your back.  You’re going to be taken down to the station.""

**(00:02:05)  Officer Miller handcuffs John Doe. There is no struggle.**

**Officer Miller:** (00:02:10) ""Everything is going to be alright.  Just relax and come with me.""

**(00:02:15)  The sound of handcuffs clicking and Officer Miller escorting John Doe out of the apartment. Background murmurs from other people continue softly.**

**(00:00:00)  Sound of police car door closing, followed by footsteps on concrete.**

**Officer Miller:** (Approaching the house)  Dispatch, Miller, arriving at 14 Oak Street.

**(00:00:15) Sound of knocking on the door.  A woman's voice can be faintly heard yelling.**

**(00:00:30) Door opens slightly, revealing a woman with red marks on her arm.  A man, slightly behind her, is holding a wooden baseball bat loosely at his side.**

**Officer Miller:** (Calmly)  Evening, ma'am.  Sir, can you please put down the bat?

**(00:00:40) The man hesitates, then slowly sets the bat against the wall inside the doorway.**

**Man:** (Voice trembling)  It... it was an accident.  She... she started it.

**Officer Miller:** (Maintaining distance, keeping hands visible)  I understand things are tense. Can you both step outside for a moment so we can talk?  I need to understand what happened.  There's no need for anyone to be hurt.

**(00:01:00) The woman, visibly shaken, steps outside. The man follows, keeping his distance from the woman and the officer.**

**Woman:** (Sobbing slightly) He... he hit me with it.  Over a silly argument.

**Officer Miller:** (To the woman) Ma'am, are you okay?  Do you need medical attention?

**Woman:** (Shaking her head)  I think I’ll be alright. Just... scared.

**(00:01:20) Officer Miller focuses on the man.**

**Officer Miller:** (To the man) Sir, I need you to explain what happened.  Please keep your hands visible and speak calmly.

**Man:**  We had a... a disagreement.  She was yelling and... I... I lost my temper.  I didn't mean to hit her.  It was just... a moment of frustration.

**(00:01:45) Officer Miller maintains eye contact but keeps a safe distance.  A faint sound of a child crying can be heard from inside the house.**

**Officer Miller:**  Sir, I understand you're upset, but violence is never the answer.  Even in the heat of the moment, you can’t strike someone.  Do you understand that?

**Man:**  Yes, officer. I understand. I'm sorry.

**(00:02:00) Officer Miller signals for backup via radio.**

**Officer Miller (into radio):**  Dispatch, Miller on scene at 14 Oak Street. Requesting backup for an arrest.  Subject is cooperating.

**(00:02:30) Backup arrives. Another officer joins the scene.**

**Officer Miller:**  Sir, I'm going to need you to place your hands behind your back.  We need to take you in for domestic assault.

**Man:** (Sighs) Okay, officer.

**(00:02:45)  The man is handcuffed without incident.  He is compliant and offers no resistance. Sound of handcuffs clicking.**

**Officer Miller:** (To backup officer)  Thank you for the backup.

**Officer Miller:** (To the woman) Ma’am, we're going to get you some help.  Is there anyone we can contact for you?

**(00:03:10) The woman provides contact information to Officer Miller. The man is escorted to a police car. The sound of car doors closing is heard.**

**Officer Miller:** (Into radio)  Dispatch, Miller, 10-4, suspects in custody.  Requesting a unit to transport the victim to the hospital for evaluation and a Domestic Violence Response Team to follow up.

**Subject:** I think... I might have gone a little over the speed limit.  I'm really sorry, officer. I wasn't paying attention.

**Officer Miller:** (Checks documents) Your license is valid.  The registration is up to date.  I did clock you going 45 in a 30 zone.  That's a significant speeding violation.  

**(00:00:35)  [Sound of radio chatter in the background - unintelligible]**

**Officer Miller:** I'm going to have to place you under arrest for speeding.  Do you understand?

**Subject:** Yes, officer. I understand.

**(00:00:48) [Sound of handcuffs clicking]**

**Subject:**  Okay, officer.

**Officer Miller:**  Alright, sir.  You've been cooperative and I appreciate that. However, this is still a violation.  A verbal warning won't cut it this time.  We're going to have to process this in the station.  

**(00:01:02) [Sound of Officer Miller patting down the subject]**

**Officer Miller:**  Do you have any weapons on you?

**22:47:20:** Officer Miller: (Maintaining defensive position)  Okay, sir. I need you to slowly back away from the door and keep your hands where they are. I'm going to call my backup and have them secure the weapon.

**(Sound of radio chatter)**

**22:47:45:** Officer Miller: It's okay, sir.  We’re just taking precautions. This is standard procedure.  Can you tell me what started the argument?  It's okay if you don't want to, we just want to make sure everyone's safe.

**22:48:02:** John Doe:  It was... it was about finances.  We're behind on bills, and we're both stressed.  I... I just reacted badly.

**22:48:18:** Officer Miller:  I can see how that would be incredibly stressful.  It's understandable that you’d feel overwhelmed. Now, please just remain calm while we secure the firearm.

**(Sound of another officer securing the firearm; muffled conversation from inside)**

**22:48:51:**  Officer Miller: (To another officer)  All clear?  Alright, sir, you're going to be placed under arrest for reckless endangerment. This is for your safety and the safety of your wife.  You have the right to remain silent... (continues reading Miranda rights)

**22:45:28:**  (Miller approaches a residence, front door slightly ajar.  Sounds of raised voices from inside.)

**Miller:**  Police Department!  Open the door slowly, please.

**(Sounds of muffled shouting, a woman’s voice crying, then the door creaks open. A dishevelled woman, Sarah Jenkins, stands in the doorway, eyes red and swollen. A man, Mark Jenkins, is visible behind her, holding a handgun.)**

**22:46:02:**  Miller: Ma'am, are you okay?  It looks like you're having a bit of a difficult time.  Can you tell me what's going on?

**Sarah Jenkins (SJ):**  He's going to kill me! He's got the gun!

**22:46:15:** Miller: (Calmly, to MJ) Sir, I understand you’re upset. Please put the gun down slowly.  Let’s talk about this.

**MJ:** (Voice shaking)  She... she cheated on me.  I can't... I just can't...

**22:47:01:** Miller:  (To MJ, with empathy) I can only imagine how painful that must be, sir.  Betrayal is incredibly difficult to deal with. But resorting to violence will only make things worse in the long run.

**Date:** October 27, 2023

**Time:** 22:45:00

**(00:00:00)  Ambient city sounds: distant traffic, faint sirens.  Miller approaches a lone figure in a dimly lit alleyway. The figure, later identified as John Doe, is visibly agitated, pacing back and forth.**

**Officer Miller:** (Calmly)  Evening, sir.  Everything alright?

**(00:00:05)  Doe turns abruptly, his hand obscured by his jacket.**

**John Doe:** (Muttering)  Mind your own business.  Get lost.

**Officer Miller:** (Calmly) Sir, I noticed you pacing here alone.  It's a little late, and this area is known for... well, for things that aren't so safe.  I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

**(00:00:15) Doe’s hand emerges from his jacket, revealing a handgun. He points it directly at Officer Miller.**

**John Doe:** (Aggressive)  I said get lost!  This is MY business!

**(00:00:18)  Sound of Miller drawing his weapon. A brief tense pause.**

**Officer Miller:** (Firmly, but controlled)  Sir, put the gun down. Put it down slowly.  Let's talk about this.

**(00:00:22)  Doe laughs harshly.**

**John Doe:** Talk? You think you can talk me out of this? I've had enough!

**(00:00:25) Doe takes a step towards Miller. Miller shouts a tactical command.**

**Officer Miller:**  DROP THE WEAPON!

**(00:00:27) Doe lunges. Miller attempts to disarm him. A struggle ensues. Sounds of grunting, shouts, and the clash of metal (weapons).**

**(00:00:35)  Sounds of a gunshot.  A sharp cry of pain from Officer Miller.**

**(00:00:38) The camera briefly shakes violently as Miller falls to the ground. The camera angle changes slightly.**

**(00:01:00)  Officer Miller groans in pain.**

**(00:01:05)  Officer Davis:**  Suspect is in custody, secured.  Requesting immediate medical assistance for Officer Miller.  Shot to the shoulder, appears serious.  We're going to need a supervisor.

**(00:00:20) (Sound of the door opening slightly, revealing Mr. Henderson's face, he appears dishevelled and agitated)**

**Mr. Henderson:** ""I told you, leave me alone!"" (He slams the door partially shut)

**Officer Miller:** ""Sir, I understand you're upset, but we're just trying to help. Can you please open the door so we can talk?""

**(00:01:55) (Mr. Henderson remains silent for a moment, then sighs heavily.)**

**Mr. Henderson:**  ""I...I just...need to be left alone.""

**Officer Miller:**  ""Okay, sir. We're going to check on you again in a few hours.  Please stay safe. We're leaving now.""
